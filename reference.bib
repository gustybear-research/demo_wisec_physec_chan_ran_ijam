	abstract = {Physical layer security schemes for wireless communications are currently crossing the chasm from theory to practice. They promise information-theoretical security, for instance by guaranteeing the conﬁdentiality of wireless transmissions. Examples include schemes utilizing artiﬁcial interference—that is ’jamming for good’—to enable secure physical layer key exchange or other security mechanisms. However, only little attention has been payed to adjusting the employed adversary models during this transition from theory to practice. Typical assumptions give the adversary antenna conﬁgurations and transceiver capabilities similar to all other nodes: single antenna eavesdroppers are the norm. We argue that these assumptions are perilous and ’invite the thief’. In this work, we evaluate the security of a representative practical physical layer security scheme, which employs artiﬁcial interference to secure physical layer key exchange. Departing from the standard single-antenna eavesdropper, we utilize a more realistic multi-antenna eavesdropper and propose a novel approach that detects artiﬁcial interferences. This facilitates a practical attack, eﬀectively ’lockpicking’ the key exchange by exploiting the diversity of the jammed signals. Using simulation and real-world software-deﬁned radio (SDR) experimentation, we quantify the impact of increasingly strong adversaries. We show that our approach reduces the secrecy capacity of the scheme by up to 97\% compared to single-antenna eavesdroppers. Our results demonstrate the risk unrealistic adversary models pose in current practical physical layer security schemes.},

	abstract = {Orthogonal blinding based schemes for wireless physical layer security aim to achieve secure communication by injecting noise into channels orthogonal to the main channel and corrupting the eavesdropper’s signal reception. These methods, albeit practical, have been proven vulnerable against multiantenna eavesdroppers who can ﬁlter the message from the noise. The vulnerability is rooted in the fact that the main channel state remains static in spite of the noise injection, which allows an eavesdropper to estimate it promptly via known symbols and ﬁlter out the noise. Our proposed scheme leverages a reconﬁgurable antenna for Alice to rapidly change the channel state during transmission and a compressive sensing based algorithm for her to predict and cancel the changing effects for Bob. As a result, the communication between Alice and Bob remains clear, whereas randomized channel state prevents Eve from launching the knownplaintext attack. We formally analyze the security of the scheme against both single and multi-antenna eavesdroppers and identify its unique anti-eavesdropping properties due to the artiﬁcially created fast-changing channel. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate its performance. Empirical results show that our scheme can suppress Eve’s attack success rate to the level of random guessing, even if she knows all the symbols transmitted through other antenna modes.},
